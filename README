NAME
    Term::InKey - Perl extension for clearing the screen and
    receiving a keystroke.

SYNOPSIS
            use Term::InKey;

            print "Press any key to clear the screen: ";
            $x = &ReadKey;
            &Clear;
            print "You pressed $x\n";

DESCRIPTION
    This module implements Clear() to clear screen and ReadKey() to
    receive a keystroke, on UNIX and Win32 platforms. As opposed to
    Term::ReadKey, it does not contain XSUB code and can be easily
    installed on Windows boxes.

TODO
    Write a function to receive a keystroke with time out. Easy with
    select() on UNIX.

COMPLIANCE
    This module works only on UNIX systems and Win32 systems.
