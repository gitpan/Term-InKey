NAME
    Term::InKey - Perl extension for clearing the screen and receiving a
    keystroke.

SYNOPSIS
            use Term::InKey;

            print "Press any key to clear the screen: ";
            $x = &ReadKey;
            &Clear;
            print "You pressed $x\n";

DESCRIPTION
    This module implements Clear() to clear screen and ReadKey() to receive
    a keystroke, on UNIX and Win32 platforms. As opposed to Term::ReadKey,
    it does not contain XSUB code and can be easily installed on Windows
    boxes.

FUNCTIONS
    *   Clear

        Clear the screen.

    *   ReadKey

        Read one keystroke.

    *   ReadPassword

        Read a password, displaying asterisk instead of the characters
        readed. Deleting one character back (DEL) and erasing the buffer
        (^U) are supported. This function accepts one argument. It can be an
        alternate char for displaying other than an asterisk, or if a
        negative number, suppresses output to the screen and only receives
        input.

TODO
    Write a function to receive a keystroke with time out. Easy with
    select() on UNIX.

COMPLIANCE
    This module works only on UNIX systems and Win32 systems.
